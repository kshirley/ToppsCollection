Hello,

Besides the 1958 Topps cards mentioned above, I have (1) a complete set of 1979 Topps Baseball, and (2) about 30-50 individual baseball cards that are pretty popular in your auctions, which I've been following for the past 6 months or so. ('62 Torre rookie, '73 Schmidt rookie (low grade), lots of NM+ from 1980-1985, multiple NM-MT+ 89 Topps Traded Griffey Jrs).

Would you consider taking these groups of cards on consignment also? I'd be happy to provide a list if that would help.

Thanks for your consideration,

Hello,

I'm a frequent buyer from your eBay auctions, and a big fan of your business!

I have three groups of cards I'd like to consign with you, which I'll describe here.

1. 1958 Topps Baseball. About 175 cards, condition is VG through EXMINT. Maybe a few NM. They're mostly commons, but there are also some nice ones, including all-star cards of Aaron, Mays, Banks, and a few other non-commons.

2. 1979 Topps Baseball complete set. Condition is NM or better. I might hold out about 5 cards to get graded (The pete rose, possibly nolan ryan). The ozzie is off-center but crisp corners and edges, and I'd like to consign that. So It might be a near-complete set, rather than a complete set, but i can be flexible depending on your process.

3. I have about 50-100 individual cards that are pretty popular in your auctions, which I've followed for a while now. Off the top of my head, 1962 Topps Joe Torre, possibly EX-EXMINT, 1973 Topps Mike Schmidt rookie (low grade) 1962 topps Ruth and Gehrig, 1963 Topps Mays and Musial, a handful of 1989 topps traded Griffey Jr. NM-MT+, a few (10-30) commons from 1962 Topps, 1964 Topps, and 1967 Topps, and a handful of HOFers from 1980-1985, all in NM condition or better.

Do you accept groups of cards like this for consignment? (i.e. not all from the same year/brand, but scattered across years and players?) I'm pretty familiar with which cards you sell on ebay, and I can assure you they're all within the range of cards I've seen you sell in the past 6 months, if that helps.

Thank you very much for your consideration,
